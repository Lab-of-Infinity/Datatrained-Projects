Abalone Case Study
Problem Statement:
The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

You have to predict the rings of each abalone which will lead us to the age of that abalone.
